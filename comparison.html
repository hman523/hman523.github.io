			Comparing programming languages!
		</h2>
		<p>
			So a few months ago, I started prime number generation just for fun.  Initially, I wrote everything in Python.  I soon learned that Python does have a performance drop from compiled languages.  This is where I put those to the test.  
		</p>
		<h3>
			Methodology
		</h3>
		<p>
			I attempted to write the exact same code but in different languages.  Thus far, I have not tested as many languages as I would like and do not have many data points.  I will attempt to write a script to run the program many times and time run time.

			<tr>
				<th>Language</th>
				<th>Time (seconds)</th>

				<td>Python 2</td>
				<td>256</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>C (GCC)</td>
				<td>3</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
